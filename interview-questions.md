# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a Ruby class?

Your answer: Super is used to add more information to a class in Ruby. When super is called it allows you to take code from another class and use it in a new one.

Researched answer: Super is a method of communication between classes in Ruby. when super is called it  allows a subclass to invoke a method from a super class. Super is particularly useful because it allows us to reuse lines of code. 

2. What is a gem?

Your answer: A gem is subset of the ruby language. Think of it this way, if ruby is a finished puzzle, the gems are all of the pieces that went in to making that puzzle complete.

Researched answer: Gems are libraries of code functionality. Gems will gather your code together and make it easier to share, and implement into applcations. Gems can be used for many different things including web development, testing, and databases. Gems are popular in the ruby community because they make sharing code/components easier.

3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a database that stores data in rows and columns. Large collections of data are often put into relational databases so that the information is more organized and easily accessible. I have not worked with other types of databases but I will research that and get back to you!

Researched answer: A relational database is a set of rows and columns, each one of these sets is called a table. This type of database is most similar to microsoft excel. There are actually many other types of databases, a few of them are spatial, document-oriented, and graph databases. These different types of databases all store different different types of data at different sizes and performance levels.

4. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

Your answer: primary keys are used in the rails frame work, and they are used to identify each class. Using keys is an efficient way to id classes. They are important because they are usually simple and easy to identify.

Researched answer: Primary keys are unique identifiers of each instance of a class. Using primary keys is a practice that ensures the consistency of data in tables and allows for swift retrieval of data, and that is why they are important. The most important use of a primary key is to establish a relationship between a table and a relational database. 

5. What are the HTTP verbs? What is each verb's corresponding CRUD action?

Your answer: The verbs are all associated with actions of CRUD. I know crud stands for create read update and delete. Therefore it is safe to assume that the http verbs will all be somewhat related to creating, reading, updating, and deleting. 

Researched answer: The HTTP verbs are get, post, put, patch, and delete. All of these requests correspond to a CRUD action. A get request allows us to display or read our content. Post is used when the client sends data or submits data to a server to Create a new resource. Put is used to Update the existing resource. Delete is used to Delete. Patch is also used to Update.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Validations are filters that make sure that only the right clean and valid data will get saved into the database. Rails automatically runs validations before content is added to the database.

2. RESTful routes: Routes are the paths that allow apps like rails or react to respond to server requests. Routes usually map to the CRUD actions that are performed.

3. ERB: ERB is an extension that stands for embedded ruby. ERB lets us write HTMLL code and drop ruby into the view file. 

4. Params: Params allow us to add more information to our programs. Info is added by passing values into the routes instead of directly to the url.

5. API: Is the application programming interface, and it transmits data in the form of JSON. API is a set of rules and conventions that make it possible for different apps to communicate with eachother.
